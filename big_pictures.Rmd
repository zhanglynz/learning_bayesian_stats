## Bayes' theorem

$$
P(A|B)=\frac{P(AB)}{P(B)}=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

## Bayesian inference idea

We have a prior (some a probability distribution); then we have data; we use
the data to **update** the prior to obtain a posterior (another probability distribution). Based on the obtained posterior, we can have all kinds of inferences. 

## Conjugate families

## Bayes computation

### Grid approximation
